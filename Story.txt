Today I got to school early
I did nothing all day until 6th
I'm sleepy now

This is supposed to be my homework
This branch will be called V2
I should've called the school branch V1

Actually I wish I could've changed the master branch to alpha, school to beta, and V2 to charlie
Oh well, this one will be delta
